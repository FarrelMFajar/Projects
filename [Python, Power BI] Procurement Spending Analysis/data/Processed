# Processed
This folder contains the cleaned and processed data, ready for analysis. These files are the output of the data cleaning and preparation steps detailed in the Jupyter Notebook (notebooks/procurement_analysis.ipynb).
* fact_purchase.csv: Cleaned transactional data.
* dim_supplier.csv: Cleaned supplier dimension table with duplicates resolved.
* dim_stock_item.csv: Cleaned stock item dimension table with versioning history corrected.
The separation of raw and processed data highlights the crucial data wrangling phase of the project, a detailed walkthrough of which can be found in the analysis notebook.
